6. Security & Privacy Architecture
Security is non-negotiable when building an autonomous system that handles banking, email, and personal communications. This section outlines required security measures.
6.1 Credential Management
Never store credentials in plain text or in your Obsidian vault.
Use environment variables for API keys: export GMAIL_API_KEY="your-key"
For banking credentials, use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or 1Password CLI)
Create a .env file (add to .gitignore immediately) for local development
Rotate credentials monthly and after any suspected breach
Example .env structure:
# .env - NEVER commit this file
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BANK_API_TOKEN=your_token
WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH=/secure/path/session
6.2 Sandboxing & Isolation
Protect against unintended actions during development:
Development Mode: Create a DEV_MODE flag that prevents any real external actions
Dry Run: All action scripts should support a --dry-run flag that logs intended actions without executing
Separate Accounts: Use test/sandbox accounts for Gmail and banking during development
Rate Limiting: Implement maximum actions per hour (e.g., max 10 emails, max 3 payments)
Example dry-run implementation:
# In any action script
DRY_RUN = os.getenv('DRY_RUN', 'true').lower() == 'true'


def send_email(to, subject, body):
    if DRY_RUN:
        logger.info(f'[DRY RUN] Would send email to {to}')
        return
    # Actual send logic here
6.3 Audit Logging
Every action the AI takes must be logged for review:
# Required log format
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:30:00Z",
  "action_type": "email_send",
  "actor": "claude_code",
  "target": "client@example.com",
  "parameters": {"subject": "Invoice #123"},
  "approval_status": "approved",
  "approved_by": "human",
  "result": "success"
}
Store logs in /Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json and retain for a minimum 90 days.
